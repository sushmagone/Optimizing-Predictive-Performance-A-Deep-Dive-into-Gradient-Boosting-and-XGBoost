## Introduction
Gradient Boosting is a powerful machine learning technique used for regression and classification problems. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an optimized version of gradient boosting that improves performance and execution speed.

This project explores these models, applying them to a dataset and evaluating their effectiveness.

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of multiple features for training and evaluation. Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization.

## Model Implementation
The project covers:
- Data preprocessing
- Training Gradient Boosting and XGBoost models
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Performance evaluation using accuracy and other metrics

## Results
The models are evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A comparison of the models' performance is presented in graphical format.

## Usage
Clone this repository and navigate to the project folder:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

Run the script to train and evaluate the models:

```sh
python train_model.py
```
